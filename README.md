# Shell_Scripting

A shell script is a text file that contains a sequence of commands for a UNIX-based operating system. 
It is called a shell script because it combines a sequence of commands, that would otherwise have to be typed into the keyboard one at a time, 
into a single script. The shell is the operating system's command-line interface (CLI) and interpreter for the set of commands that are used to 
communicate with the system



## To run any script , we first have to change the permission to execute by
##  any one command

	   chmod u+x <script_name>
